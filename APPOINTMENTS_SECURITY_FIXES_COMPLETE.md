## Date: June 26, 2025
## Status: ✅ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION

## 🎯 ISSUES RESOLVED

### 1. React Key Warning in Appointments List
**Problem**: Console error "Each child in a list should have a unique 'key' prop" when viewing appointments
**Solution**: 
- Changed appointment keys from `key={appointment._id}` to `key={`appointment-${appointment._id}`}`  
- Added validation to ensure appointments have valid `_id` fields before filtering
- Removed problematic conditional rendering that could cause duplicate keys

### 2. Security Issue: Appointments for Wrong Pets
**Problem**: User2 seeing appointments for pet "asd" that they don't own (4 appointments showing)
**Solution**:
- **Secure appointments API** (`/api/appointments/route.ts`):
  - First fetch all pets owned by current user: `{ ownerId: new ObjectId(session.user.id) }`
  - Filter appointments to only include user's pets: `{ petId: { $in: userPetIds } }`
  - Allow appointments with no specific pet: `{ petId: null }`
- **Added proper ObjectId serialization** for API consistency
- **Added debug logging** to track filtering results

### 3. React Key Warning for Veterinarians
**Problem**: Console error "Encountered two children with the same key, 'vet-undefined'"
**Solution**:
- Added validation to filter out veterinarians with undefined `_id`
- Added fallback keys: `key={`vet-${vet._id || `fallback-${index}`}`}`
- Added null checks for veterinarian properties: `vet.userId?.name || 'Unknown'`

### 4. Appointment Creation 500 Error
**Problem**: POST /api/appointments returning 500 Internal Server Error
**Solution**:
- Enhanced error handling and logging in appointments API
- Added proper ObjectId conversion for `vetId` and `petId`
- Created sample veterinarians to enable appointment booking
- Added detailed validation and error messages for debugging
