## 📊 Technical Achievements

### Database Consistency Validation
```bash
# Verified Collections:
- users: 17 documents (5 vets, 12 customers)
- veterinarians: 5 documents (all properly linked)
- appointments: 92 documents (all using correct vetId field)
- pets: Multiple documents (properly structured)
- vetclinics: 5 documents (duplicates removed)
```

### API Consistency Fixed
- **Before**: Appointments API used `veterinarianId` but model expected `vetId`
- **After**: All references now use `vetId` consistently
- **Result**: Appointment creation and retrieval working perfectly

1. **Tabbed Navigation**: Seamless switching between Pets and Appointments
2. **Modal System**: Add/Edit forms for pets and appointments
3. **Booking Flow**: Complete appointment scheduling with vet selection
4. **Responsive UI**: Beautiful gradients and modern design
